# /work — execute a tracked plan from `./.plans`

Start (or resume) **implementation** of a ready plan. Plans are git-tracked
markdown under **`.plans/`** (dotdir — use that path explicitly; many UIs hide it).

If `.plans/README.md` exists, treat it as the process contract. This command is
the entrypoint; do not re-derive priority rules from chat history alone.

**Fleet script paths in this file assume the Anchor source tree's own
`scripts/`.** This same file is also scaffolded verbatim into every dependent
project, where fleet tooling lives under **`.anchor/scripts/`** instead —
substitute that prefix throughout when `scripts/<name>.py` isn't at the
project root but `.anchor/scripts/<name>.py` is.

**Path is authoritative.** A plan’s lane and lifecycle are determined only by
which directory it lives in — never by `Lane:` or `Status:` fields inside the
file. Ignore those fields if present; do not write them.

`$ARGUMENTS` is everything after `/work`. Parse flags and the optional target from it.

## Usage

| Invocation | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `/work` | Pick highest-priority **model-fit** ready plan and execute it |
| `/work --list` | List ready plans (incl. Preferred models + fit); **do not** implement |
| `/work --no-fit-check` | Same priority as bare `/work`, but **skip model-fit filtering** (still one plan, not the whole backlog) |
| `/work --no-fit-check <slug>` | Execute that plan even if Preferred models say otherwise |
| `/work <slug>` | Match `slug.md` or `slug.local.md` under ready lanes |
| `/work .plans/features/foo.md` | Execute that path if it is a ready-lane file |

## Lanes (hard rules)

| Path | Read? | Execute? | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| `.plans/bugs/` | yes | **yes** (pick → move to in-progress) | highest priority ready |
| `.plans/features/` | yes | **yes** (after all bugs) | ready |
| `.plans/in-progress/` | yes | **only if you moved it there** | claimed; others **ignore** |
| `.plans/ambiguous/` | yes | **no** | half-baked; agent may park here |
| `.plans/blocked/` | yes | **no** | cannot fix now; agent may park here |
| `.plans/review-needed/` | yes | **no** | agent believes `Done when` holds, awaiting human sign-off; human runs **`/review`** (AI + survey): Approve merges feature→dev then → `completed/`; Needs Work → `bugs|features/`; empty queue may Promote dev→main |
| `.plans/drafts/` | yes (edit plan only) | **no** | |
| `.plans/completed/` | yes (history) | **no** | |

**Never** implement from `drafts/` or `completed/`. **Bare `/work` never scans
`in-progress/`** — it picks only ready lanes. Every in-progress plan is **owned**
by whoever claimed it (a **required lease** under `.plans/.leases/` with an agent
id). **Ignore** every in-progress plan you do not own; a foreign, unleased, or
expired-lease in-progress plan is **never** silently reclaimed. Resuming your own
in-progress work is an **explicit named claim** (`/work in-progress/<slug>.md`,
or `work_once.py --recover` for an expired lease) — not a bare-pick side effect.
If the user names a draft: refuse execution; offer **edit-only**. Do **not** promote it.

### Agent move rule (hard)

Agents may relocate plan files **only** as:

```text
bugs|features/     →  in-progress/     (start work + lease)
in-progress/       →  review-needed/   (Done when holds — default agent finish)
in-progress/       →  completed/       (ONLY after the operator answers "merge to dev
                                        now" at culmination AND the scoped-merge gate
                                        passes — see §6. Never self-certified.)
review-needed/     →  completed/       (HUMAN ONLY via /review Approve)
review-needed/     →  in-progress/     (human requested changes; agent resumes)
review-needed/     →  bugs|features/   (release/return; also /review Needs Work)
bugs|features|in-progress/  →  ambiguous/   (half-baked)
bugs|features|in-progress/  →  blocked/     (cannot fix now)
in-progress/       →  bugs|features/   (release for others)
ambiguous|blocked/ →  bugs|features/   (return when unblocked)
```

**Preserve basename** on every move (including `.local.md`). Agents must **never**
drop or add the `.local` suffix; only a human may rename for privacy/tracking.

Agents must **never** promote drafts except via **`/draft --promote`**, move work
into `drafts/`, move `review-needed/` → `completed/` except under a human-confirmed
**`/review` Approve**, or touch another agent's `in-progress/` plan.

`in-progress/` → `completed/` is **not** an agent self-certify path. It happens only
as the tail of a merge the **operator** authorized in-session (§6): question asked,
answer given, scoped-merge gate passed. Unattended runs — `work_once.py`, fleet
workers, the coordinator MCP — never ask, never merge, and always finish to
`review-needed/`.

## Priority (when no target is given)

Bare `/work` picks from **ready lanes only** (`bugs/`, `features/`). It never
scans `in-progress/` to resume or reclaim — resume is an explicit named target.

1. All of `.plans/bugs/*.md` before any feature.
2. Within each lane, order by header `Priority: P1 | P2 | P3` (default **P2** if
   absent): P1 → P2 → P3; then `Value: high | medium | low` (default **medium**):
   high → medium → low; then oldest first (mtime), ties by filename.
3. Among ready plans, keep only **model-fit** plans (next section) — unless
   `--no-fit-check` is set.
4. **Skip plans with unmet `Depends on`** — do not start; report blockers.
5. **Skip plans assigned to a human.** An `- **Assignee:**` header whose value
   is a person's name, username, email, or `human` means a person completes it —
   never bare-pick or claim it, whatever its fit. (Absent, `ai`, `agent`, or
   `unassigned` = agent-eligible.) You **may** still read it and edit its body to
   add a status/progress note or answer a question, and commit that; you just
   never move it to `in-progress/`/`review-needed/`/`completed/`. `plan_fit.py`
   and the pickers already filter these out.
6. Skip `drafts/`, `completed/`, `ambiguous/`, `blocked/`, `review-needed/`,
   **all** `in-progress/` (owned by whoever claimed it), and `README.md`.

**Less-reliable / small models:** don't reason about lanes by hand — run the
deterministic picker, which only ever returns ready work and claims it atomically
(move + lease together):

```bash
python scripts/plan_fit.py --tier <yours> --effort <current>   # what fits me, and why
python scripts/plan_select.py --next            # print the next ready plan
python scripts/plan_select.py --next --claim --agent-id <id>   # + claim it
```

If multiple plans share the top priority, **just pick the first in sorted order**
(Priority → Value → oldest → filename) and start — this is the default; do **not**
print a menu or ask which to run. Name the other tied plans in one line so the
user can redirect if they want a different one. Only pause to ask when the user
**explicitly** asks to choose (e.g. "let me pick", "which should I run?").

## Model fit (required)

Plan headers SHOULD include:

```markdown
- **Preferred models:** <names and/or tiers>
```

Tiers: `small` | `mid` | `reasoner` | `frontier` (see `.anchor/templates/plan.md`,
`.anchor/ANCHOR.md` routing, `.anchor/model-fitness.md`). Absent field → treat as
**mid** (any solid executor; not a free pass for wasteful frontier pickup of
obviously trivial work after you load the Goal) — a **ceiling hint, not a
floor**: it does not exclude `small`.

### Know yourself

Before selecting a plan, identify **all three**:

1. **Model name + fit tier** — your identity is the **harness/system-prompt**
   product name (or an explicit `/model`/`--model`/endpoint override), never a
   guess from training weights. Use `.anchor/model-fitness.md` and the
   plan-template table. **Name and catalog tier win over vibes** — e.g. if the
   harness says "You are Grok 4.6", you report **Grok 4.6** and match Preferred
   `mid`/named "Grok 4.6"; report Grok 4.5 only when the harness actually says
   4.5. Temporary-coordinator eligibility is not the same as “treat every `mid`
   plan as overqualified.”
2. **Cost posture** when the product supports it: current **reasoning effort** /
   thinking mode if known (`low` | `medium` | `high` | `xhigh` | …). **Grok family
   effort map (4.5/4.6):** reported effort sets **effective fit tier**
   (`low`→mid, `medium`/`high`→reasoner, `xhigh`→frontier; **unknown effort →
   mid**). Report `<harness-named product> @ <effort> → effective <tier>` before
   Preferred matching — e.g. `Grok 4.6 @ high → effective reasoner` (a lookup by
   harness name, never a pick from the cost ladder). **Non-Grok products:** high
   effort remains a **cost dial only**, not a tier promotion.
3. **Cheaper capacity** on this host/fleet (next subsection) — required whenever
   fit is poor **or** the top ready work is `small`/`mid` while this session is
   expensive (true higher tier, or mid model stuck on high effort).

### Let the script decide fit

Do not judge fit by reading plan headers — it is a mechanical rule, and models
get it wrong in both directions. Ask:

```bash
python scripts/plan_fit.py --tier <yours> [--model <name>] [--effort <current>]
```

One `take:`/`skip:` line per ready plan with the reason, plus an effort note when
your dial is off for that plan's tier (`--endpoint <name>` instead of `--tier`
for fleet workers; `--json` for tooling). It is read-only — claim with
`plan_select.py --next --claim` once you have picked. Its verdicts *are* the
rules below; if your judgment disagrees with it, the script is right.

### Cheaper capacity probe

Before hard-skipping overqualified work, and when about to burn a high-cost
session on `small`/`mid` Preferred, probe for a **lesser configured executor**:

1. **Fleet registry:** `scripts/endpoints.yaml` (or project registry). Map
   registry tiers → fit tiers: `swarm`→`small`,
   `executor`|`executor-heavy`|`detached`→`mid`, `reasoner`→`reasoner`,
   `frontier`→`frontier`. Keep endpoints whose mapped tier is **≤** the plan’s
   highest Preferred tier (or named models that match Preferred).
2. **Reachability:** listed ≠ live. A cheap connect/list (or prior known-down
   note) is enough; unreachable workers do not count as delegation targets.
3. **Product-local models:** smaller models registered in this harness (custom
   OpenAI-compatible endpoints, local NIM, etc.).
4. **Project conventions:** model-priority / Preferred orchestrator in
   `.anchor/conventions.md` or `ANCHOR-CONVENTIONS.md` when present.

**If a cheaper reachable worker fits the plan:** do **not** claim it on bare
`/work` in this expensive session. Print one line with the dispatch path, e.g.:

```text
python scripts/work_once.py --once --endpoint <name> --registry scripts/endpoints.yaml
```

(or “open a session on \<model\>”). Leave the plan unclaimed for that worker.

**If none are configured or reachable:** you are the available executor — do
**not** permanent-refuse mid work. Apply **same-model cost right-size** (next)
and/or wait for the operator to paste the suggested command.

### Reasoning effort / same-model cost right-size

When no cheaper worker is available (or the operator already chose this model
to clear the backlog), map the plan’s Preferred tier → a suggested effort and
**emit a pasteable platform command**. Never silently change product settings
yourself if only the human/UI can.

| Preferred (use highest listed tier) | Suggested effort on reasoning models |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `small` | `low` (or `minimal` / `none` if the product offers them) |
| `mid` | `low` (Grok: **`low` only** — `medium` already → reasoner) |
| `reasoner` | `high` |
| `frontier` | `high` or `xhigh` as needed |

**Pasteable commands (use what this product documents):**

| Product | Lower cost for `small`/`mid` work | Raise for `reasoner`+ work |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Grok Build (TUI)** | `/effort low` — or `/model <id> low` | `/effort high` or `/effort xhigh` (4.6) |
| **Grok CLI / headless** | `--effort low` / `--reasoning-effort low` | `--effort high` |
| **API (Grok-class)** | `reasoning_effort: "low"` | `"high"` |
| **Nemotron / Qwen3 hybrid** | thinking **off** for bulk execute | thinking **on** for plan/critic |
| **No effort dial (e.g. some Claude sessions)** | switch session to Haiku / local executor | switch up a tier |

Effort vs fit:

- **Grok + reported effort:** use **effective tier** for good/under/overqualified
  (e.g. Grok 4.6 @ high is effective reasoner — **overqualified for Preferred `mid`/`small` only**;
  Grok 4.6 @ xhigh is effective frontier — **overqualified for `small`, `mid`, and `reasoner`**;
  Grok @ low (or omitted) is mid — underqualified for Preferred `reasoner`/`frontier` only;
  **Grok @ medium already promotes to reasoner** (overqualified for mid-only — use `low`);
  Grok 4.5 @ xhigh coerces to high → reasoner, not frontier). Pass
  `--effort` to `plan_fit` / `work_once` when known.
- **Good fit + wasteful effort on `small`/`mid` Preferred:** print the lower-effort
  command (`/effort low`) in one line, then **execute** (or pause one turn if the
  operator must apply a slash command first). On **non-Grok** models, do **not**
  reclassify as overqualified solely because effort is high.
- **True overqualified** (effective tier above all Preferred, e.g. Fable or
  Grok@xhigh or Fable on `small`/`mid` only) **+ no cheaper worker + operator needs progress:**
  suggest lower effort / cheaper endpoint **and** `/work --no-fit-check` if needed;
  stop unless they insist. Use Rule 2's terse skip format.
- **Underqualified:** still skip. On Grok, suggest **raising** `/effort` (medium /
  high / xhigh on 4.6) when the map would make you eligible; on other products,
  cranking effort is not a substitute for a stronger model.

### Matching

A plan is a **good fit** if you match any listed name (fuzzy: "Sonnet",
"Sonnet-class", "Claude Sonnet 5", "Grok 4.5") or your tier is among the listed
tiers / clearly in the same class.

| Fit | Meaning | Bare `/work` |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **good** | You are in Preferred models / same class | Eligible (apply effort right-size if needed) |
| **overqualified** | You are a clearly higher **tier** than all preferred (e.g. Fable/frontier on `small`/`mid` only) | **Skip** (Rule 2 format) if cheaper capacity exists; else probe + effort/`--no-fit-check` suggestions |
| **underqualified** | Every **tier** the plan lists is above yours (e.g. it lists `reasoner`/`frontier` only and you are `mid`) | **Skip** (Rule 2 format) — leave for stronger models |
| **unknown** | No **Preferred models** line, or a list with no tier and no name you match | **Eligible** — claim after a one-line fit note (this is what `work_once.py` does) |

### Do not under-rate yourself (the floor is a tier, not a vibe)

Symmetric to the cheaper-capacity probe above: an unnecessary skip stalls the
backlog exactly the way a wasteful frontier pickup burns credits. Before you
classify yourself **underqualified**, check all four:

1. **Only listed tiers set the floor.** `small | mid | reasoner | frontier` are
   the gate. Product **names** in the list are *extra* good-fit hits, never a
   raised floor — `**Preferred models:** mid, Claude Sonnet 5, Grok 4.5` is a
   **good** fit for any `mid` worker, named or not.
2. **Names-only lists do not gate.** A list of only names, none of them you, is
   **unknown** — eligible after a one-line fit note. (`classify_fit` in
   `scripts/plan_select.py` returns `unknown` here; a session that skips is
   stricter than the harness, and wrong.)
3. **A missing Preferred line does not gate.** Unlabeled work is unlabeled, not
   reserved for a higher tier.
4. **A hard step inside a good-fit plan is not a fit failure.** Difficulty you
   find *after* claiming is a per-step **Route to** / `## Escalation triggers`
   question, or a return-to-ready hand-back — not grounds to refuse the claim.
   Claim it, run the steps you own, escalate the step.

Escalate on your **weak column** (`.anchor/model-fitness.md`) and on
orchestration-class work — not on the mere existence of a stronger model. "A
better model could do this" is true of nearly every plan and is not a fit
verdict.

**Specialty axis (dual-axis fit):** after power/tier fit is OK, judge whether
you are the right *kind* of model for the plan (profiles in
`.anchor/model-fitness.md`: `coding-agent`, `terminal-agent`, `critic`,
`planner`, `general-chat`, `multimodal`, `swarm-local`). Material specialty
mismatch → entire first line `SUGGEST-REROUTE: <target or profile> — <reason>`
and stop unless the operator insists (same insist contract as escalate). Example:
swarm-local / general-chat session leaving multi-file software for
`coding-agent`. Good fit on **both** power and specialty → silence. Preferred
models may list profile tags next to tiers; mechanical `plan_fit` / pickers still
use tiers + names only — profile tags guide self-assessment.

### Rules

1. **Bare `/work`:** never start a plan that is overqualified or underqualified
   for you. Pick the highest-priority **good** fit instead. On good-fit
   `small`/`mid` work, still run the effort right-size note when the session is
   on high reasoning cost.
2. **All ready plans are poor fit — keep the refusal short.** A skip is a
   one-line verdict plus at most two `→` lines, then **stop**. Do not silently
   burn the wrong tier — and do not pad the refusal either:

   ```text
   skip: features/<slug> — underqualified (Preferred: reasoner; you: Sonnet 5/mid)
   → python scripts/work_once.py --once --endpoint h100-nemotron --registry scripts/endpoints.yaml
   → /work --no-fit-check <slug> to run it here anyway
   ```

   One verdict line **per skipped plan** (a table only past ~4). The probe
   appears *only* as the target in the `→` line — narrating what you checked and
   what was unreachable is noise unless it changes the recommendation or the
   user asks. Do **not** restate the plan's Goal, re-derive the fit rules, or
   justify the tier call at length; the verdict line already says it. No
   `## Result` footer on a turn that did no work.
3. **`--no-fit-check`:** disable Preferred-models / tier filtering for this
   invocation only. Still pick **one** plan by normal lane/Value priority (or
   the named slug/path). Still **state fit in one line** before executing so the
   mismatch is visible — do not pretend the recommendation matched. Still
   suggest effort right-size when applicable. Does **not** mean “run every plan
   in `.plans/`.”
4. **User names slug/path** (without `--no-fit-check`): explicit target overrides
   the skip — but **state the fit mismatch in one line first**, then proceed.
   Include effort/delegate suggestions when the mismatch is cost, not capability.
5. **`--list`:** for each ready plan show path, lane (from directory), Priority,
   Value, Preferred models, and your fit (`good` / `overqualified` / `underqualified` /
   `unknown`). Optionally note suggested effort and any cheaper endpoint that
   would fit. Do not implement. Fit is still computed under `--list` even if
   `--no-fit-check` is also passed (list is informational).
6. Per-step **Route to** still applies after load for mixed-difficulty steps
   (Sonnet default; Opus/reasoner for deep/security; frontier for multi-hour
   autonomy via plan-then-delegate; smaller/local for mechanical rows).
7. **Operator already said use this model efficiently / no local yet:** treat
   as authorization to execute **good-fit** (and explicit-target) work here after
   stating the effort command; still probe so you can recommend local setup
   later (`/local-models`, registry entries) without blocking progress now.

Right-size works both ways: expensive models leave cheap work for cheaper
workers when those exist; when they do not, same-model effort downshift keeps
the queue moving. Small models do not grab architecture plans to "try hard."

## Steps

### 1. Resolve project root and inventory

- Find the git repo root (or CWD if not a git repo).
- Confirm `.plans/` exists (`ls -la .plans` — include the leading dot).
- If missing: stop and explain that `/work` needs a `.plans/` tree; point at
  Anchor's formalize-plans workflow or create the layout if the user asks.
- Inventory: your `in-progress/` (if any), then ready `bugs/`, `features/`.
  **Ignore** foreign `in-progress/` files. Skim headers for Priority, Value, and
  Preferred models only (not Status/Lane).

### 2. Parse arguments

- Flags may combine with a slug/path: e.g. `/work --no-fit-check formalize-plans-workflow`.
- `--list` / `-l` → list ready plans (path, lane-from-dir, Value, Preferred
  models, fit); stop.
- `--no-fit-check` → disable model-fit skip for this run (see Model fit rules);
  does not change lane priority and does not execute more than one plan.
- Otherwise treat remaining token as **slug** or **path**.
- Path under `drafts/` or `completed/` → refuse execute (see lanes).
- Slug: find unique match for `{slug}.md` or `{slug}.local.md` under ready
  lanes; if zero or many matches, report and stop or disambiguate.

### 3. Load the plan

- Read the full markdown file.
- Restate **Goal**, **Preferred models**, **Depends on**, and **Done when** in ≤10 lines.
- **Dependencies:** verify each Depends-on slug is satisfied (under `completed/` or
  git history of `completed/`, and not still open elsewhere). If unmet → **do not
  execute**; report blockers.
- Do **not** rewrite the plan unless a step is impossible (then stop and say why).
- If a `## Progress` checklist exists, resume from its first unchecked
  (`- [ ]`) bullet — that is what "first incomplete step" means concretely.

### 4. Mark in progress

- If the plan is still under `bugs/` or `features/`, **claim it** — move it to
  `.plans/in-progress/` (same filename) **and record a lease** with your stable
  agent id, together. The claim is **required**, not optional: it is what marks
  the plan as yours so other agents skip it. Do this atomically with the picker
  (`python scripts/plan_select.py --next --claim --agent-id <id>`, or
  `work_once.py --once --agent-id <id>`), which writes the lease under
  `.plans/.leases/` as it moves the file. A bare `git mv` with no lease leaves the
  plan looking unowned — don't do that.
- **Long-running work:** the lease has a long TTL (24h); a live agent refreshes
  it (`work_once.py --heartbeat in-progress/<slug>.md --agent-id <id>`) so its
  plan never looks orphaned. Only a lease left untouched past the TTL is
  reclaimable, and only via an explicit `--recover`.
- Optionally add or update a brief `## Progress` note. Do **not** write
  `Status:` or `Lane:` fields.

### 5. Execute

- Walk **## Steps** in order (table rows or numbered list).
- For each step: do the work; run its **Verify by** command when present.
- One step at a time; no opportunistic drive-bys outside the plan's file scope.
- If the plan has a `## Progress` checklist, check off (`- [x]`) that step's
  bullet once its Verify by passes. Advisory only — never required, never a
  gate; skip silently if the plan predates the convention.
- Two failed fix attempts on the same error → stop; summarize attempts +
  hypothesis; escalate (do not thrash).
- Honor per-step **Route to** (fleet offload / escalate / downgrade) when present.

### 6. Complete or pause

**Done when** all checklist items hold and verifications pass:

1. If the plan has a `## Progress` checklist, check off `Done when holds`
   (and confirm every Step bullet is checked).
2. Run **`/commit-prep`**, then commit on `feature/<slug>` (see the Git section).
   **Record the SHA you just committed** — the merge gate below needs it.
3. Ask the **culmination question** (below), then follow the answer.
4. Session footer: `## Result`, `## How to verify`, `## Deferred / concerns`,
   including the plan's new path, the chosen handoff outcome, and the
   `pending_merges.py --brief` line.

#### The culmination question

Ask it **once**, and only when **all** of these hold:

- `/commit-prep` gates are **green**
- the `feature/<slug>` commit succeeded (the plan produced actual commits)
- the session is **interactive** (a human can answer right now)
- the project uses Git

Otherwise skip it entirely — red gates, unattended runs, and no-op plans go
straight to `review-needed/` as before, with a one-line note saying why no
question was asked.

```text
Plan '<slug>' is done and committed on feature/<slug>. What now?
  1. Review it now (default) — /review does an AI critic pass, then you sign off
  2. Merge to dev now — I checked the work; land it without a review cycle
  3. Hold for testing — leave the branch and worktree; I'll come back to it
```

| Answer | What `/work` does |
|--------|-------------------|
| **1. Review it now** | Plan → `review-needed/`; hand off to `/review <slug>` |
| **2. Merge to `dev` now** | Run the scoped-merge gate. **Pass** → merge, plan → `completed/` with a `## Handoff` note. **Any failure** → fall back to answer 1 and say which check refused |
| **3. Hold for testing** | Plan → `review-needed/` with a `## Handoff` hold note; leave branch + worktree intact |

Never infer the answer. Not from an earlier "yes", not from a flag, not from a
config default, not from "the operator usually merges". No answer → answer 1.

#### The scoped-merge gate (answer 2 only)

All six must hold, else **refuse and fall back to `/review`**:

1. **Provenance** — `feature/<slug>` HEAD is exactly the commit this run made.
2. **Clean tree** — nothing staged, unstaged, or untracked.
3. **File scope** — every path named **anywhere in the range history**
   (`base..head`), not only the net tree-to-tree diff, is inside this run's
   **touched set**: the plan's Steps `Touches` column, the plan file's own lane
   move, and the paths `/commit-prep` reported (CHANGELOG, blog, docs). A path
   added and then deleted still counts.
4. **Mergeable** — fast-forward preferred; otherwise a conflict-free merge.
5. **Target** — the integration branch (`dev`, else `develop`) **only**. A target
   resolving to `main`/`master` aborts the merge path.
6. **Human answer** — given in this session, in direct response to the question.

Checks 1–5 are mechanical; run them with the helper rather than by eye:

```bash
python scripts/merge_feature.py --root <checkout> --slug <slug> \
  --touched <file-with-one-path-per-line> --expect-head <sha you committed> --dry-run
# exit 0 would merge · 3 scope violation · 4 precondition · 5 conflict · 2 git error
#      6 merge staged, NOT committed — finish it with the flags below
```

`--expect-head` is **required** — provenance is a must-hold condition, and without
the SHA there is nothing to check the branch against. The clean-tree check follows the
**feature branch's** worktree rather than `--root`, so it still inspects the tree that
did the work. Point `--root` at a checkout
where the integration branch is **free**: git refuses to check out a branch that is
live in another worktree, so with `/work` in `var/worktrees/<agent>` and your main
checkout on `dev`, run it against the main checkout. The gate detects that conflict
up front and names the path to re-run against instead of failing mid-merge.

Drop `--dry-run` to land it. **A non-fast-forward merge exits `6` — staged, not
committed** — because the merged tree is state neither branch was prepped in, so
the helper stages it and hands control back. Exit `6` is neither success nor
failure: never report it as merged. Run `/commit-prep` against the merged tree,
then finish it with **one** of:

```bash
python scripts/merge_feature.py --root <checkout> --commit-staged   # prep green
python scripts/merge_feature.py --root <checkout> --abort-staged    # prep red
```

A fast-forward exits `0` with a real SHA and owes nothing further.

`--commit-staged` stages everything before committing — prep edits the *working
tree*, and a bare `git commit` during a merge would drop its output.
`--abort-staged` falls back to a hard reset because `git merge --abort` refuses
once prep has touched a merged file; that discards prep's edits to **tracked**
files, while anything prep *created* is untracked and survives on disk. Both
finishers refuse rather than guess if you resolved the merge by hand in between
(`MERGE_HEAD` existing is not enough — it is checked against the exact commit that
was merged, so a *different* staged merge is refused rather than committed under
this plan's name; the branch itself may advance, which is what fixing a red prep
does). `--abort-staged` then clears the stale record without resetting anything, because
a reset against a tree the record no longer describes destroys unrelated work
rather than undoing a merge. The checkout stays mid-merge until one of them runs,
so never end a session on an exit `6` without saying so.

A run can also report **already contained**: every commit on the branch is
already on the integration branch (it was merged earlier and the branch has
since been left behind). That exits `0` like a successful merge, because the
work *is* integrated — but it says so explicitly rather than printing a SHA
that implies this run moved something, and it touches nothing.

The helper also refuses when `--root` already has a merge in progress or an
unfinished staged record, or when it holds uncommitted/untracked files. That
last one applies to **any run that actually merges, `--dry-run` included**: the
gate probes for conflicts with a real `git merge` and ends the probe with
`git reset --hard`, which cannot tell your uncommitted edits from merge
residue — so "merge nothing" would still cost you them. Point `--root` at a
*clean* integration checkout. The two runs that touch nothing are exempt: a
fast-forward, and an already-contained branch — neither probes nor commits.

The helper never pushes, never force-updates, never deletes a branch, and refuses
mainline targets. **Do not** pass the operator's
answer to it — check 6 is yours to hold, and a flag would be exactly the inference
this path forbids.

**Rejected by design:** landing only the in-scope paths
(`git checkout feature/<slug> -- <paths>`) when the scope check fails. That
fabricates a commit matching no branch state and hides the out-of-scope change. A
scope violation means the branch is not what `/work` thinks it is — precisely when
a human review is warranted.

#### `## Handoff` note formats

Append to the plan body (never a `Status:`/`Lane:` field — path stays authoritative):

```markdown
## Handoff
merged to dev by /work 2026-08-01 — no /review sign-off
```
```markdown
## Handoff
hold — waiting on staging data — 2026-08-01
```
```markdown
## Handoff
handed to /review 2026-08-01
```

The merged form is what makes a skipped review **auditable** — `/review --list` and
`pending_merges.py` both surface it later.

#### Answers 1 and 3

`git mv` the plan from `in-progress/` to `.plans/review-needed/` (create the dir if
needed) and drop its lease. **Then commit that move** via the light path — the
`/commit-prep` exemption for plans-only commits: state what moved and why, then
`git add .plans/` and `git commit -m "…" -- .plans/`; no CHANGELOG, no blog, no test run.
The pathspec matters — a bare `git commit` would sweep in anything else already
staged. If this plan is untracked (`*.local.md`, or a project that ignores
`.plans/`), say “lane move (untracked)” and commit nothing. That move means *agent asserts Done when* — it is not a
final archive. Tell the human to run **`/review`** (or `/review <slug>`): AI critic
+ survey — Approve merges `feature/<slug>` → `dev` then → `completed/`; Needs Work →
`bugs|features/`; Skip. Never move `review-needed/` → `completed/` yourself.

**If the user stops mid-plan:** leave the file in **`in-progress/`** with a
brief `## Progress` note. If a checklist is present, leave unfinished bullets
`- [ ]` — do **not** check off a step you didn't actually finish; an
optional freeform line below the checklist may note why/next-action. Do
**not** move to `completed/` or `review-needed/`. Other agents must ignore it.

**If the plan is half-baked:** move to `.plans/ambiguous/` and note what is missing.

**If you cannot fix the issue:** move to `.plans/blocked/` (out of ready queue) or
return to `bugs/`|`features/` (release for another agent).

## Output footer

End every substantive `/work` turn with:

```text
## Result
## How to verify
## Deferred / concerns
```

On a turn that finished a plan, `## Result` also carries the handoff outcome
(reviewed / merged to `dev` / held) and the one-line unmerged summary:

```bash
python scripts/pending_merges.py --root <repo> --brief
# handoff: 3 branch(es) ahead of dev · 1 completed awaiting merge · 1 held
```

## Git worktrees + branches + commits (when the project uses Git)

**One working tree ⇒ one HEAD.** Parallel agents must not share a single checkout.

### Worktree (preferred for parallel agents)

Before substantive code edits, ensure a **per-agent worktree** and do all file
work there:

```bash
python scripts/worktree_for_agent.py ensure \
  --project <repo> --agent-id <your-id> --slug <plan-slug>
# or after claim: work_once.py … --ensure-worktree
```

Layout: `var/worktrees/<agent-id>/` + `registry.json`. The helper ensures
integration **`dev`**/`develop` (creates **`dev` from `main`/`master`** if
missing). Optional `--slug` checks out `feature/<slug>` inside the worktree.

### Integration + feature branch

1. Prefer **`dev`**, else **`develop`**; create **`dev` from main/master** if neither
   exists (report creation; push `origin dev` when allowed).
2. Feature branch `feature/<slug>` **in your worktree**. `/work` may land it on
   **integration only** (`dev`/`develop`), and only through §6's culmination
   question + scoped-merge gate. `/work` **never** merges to `main`/`master` and
   never merges on its own initiative — mainline is reached solely through
   `/review`'s empty-queue **Promote**.
3. When plan work is complete (Done when holds / finishing `/work`):
   - Run **`/commit-prep`** first (**prep only** — tests, CHANGELOG, blog).
   - If gates are **green**: **stage + commit on the feature branch** (HEREDOC
     message). Optional `git push -u origin HEAD` when a remote feature branch is
     expected. Report branch + commit SHA — §6's provenance check needs it.
   - If gates are **red**: do not commit; fix or stop per stop rules. No commit
     means no culmination question.
   - **Never** commit on `main`/`master`/`dev`/`develop`. Merging happens only as
     §6 describes: operator asked, operator answered, gate passed. Unattended runs
     hand off to **`/review`** instead.

## Out of scope

- Creating new plans (use **`/draft`** → `.plans/drafts/`; optional `--local`)
- **Promoting** drafts → ready (use **`/draft --promote <slug>`**; never from `/work`)
- Executing every ready plan in one shot unless the user explicitly asks to
  continue to the next after finishing one
- Running `git commit` **without** `/commit-prep`, or committing when the user did
  not ask and the plan does not require it
- **Merging on your own initiative** — the culmination merge needs the operator's
  in-session answer *and* a passing scoped-merge gate. Unattended paths
  (`work_once.py`, fleet workers, the coordinator MCP) never ask and never merge;
  they finish to `review-needed/`
- Merging to `main`/`master` under any answer — that is `/review`'s promotion survey
- **Documenting plan backlog** as product docs (hard rule: docs describe **current
  shipped state**, not `.plans/` contents). When work ships, document the code —
  not this plan file.
