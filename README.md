## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)

### Running the Server
1. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:3000`

   **Note**: Your browser will show a security warning because the SSL certificate is self-signed. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" to continue. This is normal for local development.

The server will serve the static files over HTTPS, enabling the YouTube player functionality.
