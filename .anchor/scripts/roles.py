"""Role→capability map: planner / executor / critic as harness-enforced
capability sets, not prompt framing (ANCHOR.md role separation; mythos-core
rule 2 cross-ref).

One module owns the map — ``orchestrate.py`` and the project-orchestrator MCP
server both read it; nothing re-declares role powers elsewhere.

- **planner** — read anything; write only under ``.plans/**`` (plans and spec
  drafts); never dispatches executors.
- **executor** — write per task-spec scope (the scope gate enforces the spec;
  this map adds the role boundary): never ``.plans/**`` and never its own spec.
- **critic** — read-only; its output is the review artifact, not file edits.
- **orchestrator** — the coordinating process itself; unrestricted writes and
  the only role that dispatches.

Path rules reuse ``scope_gate.path_matches`` (one glob implementation, one
semantics — see that module's docstring). Deny patterns win over allow.
