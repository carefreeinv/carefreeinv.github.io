"""The orchestrator pattern as a runnable loop: plan → execute (fresh context per task) →
verify (tooling, not trust) → critic review. Frontier judgment twice, cheap tokens between.

Usage:
  python orchestrate.py --goal "Add CSV export to the report page" --verify "pytest -q"
  python orchestrate.py --plan-file .plans/features/foo.md --hold-on-fail  # detached/Space-1
  python orchestrate.py --plan-file .plans/bugs/fix-login.md --verify "pytest -q"

The plan is produced by the 'planner' role (point it at a frontier model, Nemotron
thinking-on, or a committed ready plan via --plan-file under .plans/bugs|features).
Paths under .plans/drafts/ or .plans/completed/ are rejected.

Roles are harness-enforced capability sets (scripts/roles.py), not prompt framing:
writes made during the planner phase may only touch .plans/**, executor writes may
never touch .plans/** or the task spec, and the critic phase may write nothing.
Role transitions are logged as explicit orchestrator events; a role violation is a
hard error — the run still emits its outputs (plan/review text and the run JSON),
then exits 4.

A task that outgrows one context window degrades into a planned continuation
rather than a truncated answer: near its declared ceiling the executor is told to
emit a structured handoff (`anchor/templates/handoff.md`, parsed by
`scripts/handoff.py`), and the orchestrator respawns a *fresh* context seeded with
it — up to `--max-respawns` (default 2), after which the task is reported back to
the planner as a decomposition error rather than respawned again.
