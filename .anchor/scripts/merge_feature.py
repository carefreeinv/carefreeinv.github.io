"""Land a finished ``feature/<slug>`` on the integration branch — but only when a
mechanical gate proves the branch is exactly what the caller thinks it is.

This is the machinery behind ``/work``'s end-of-run **"merge to dev now"** answer.
The normal path remains ``/review``: an AI critic plus a human survey. This path
trades the critic for a much narrower mandate — the operator watched the work
happen, so the gate's job is to prove nothing *else* rode along:

1. **Provenance** — the branch head is the commit the caller just made.
2. **Clean tree** — nothing staged, unstaged, or untracked.
3. **File scope** — every path named **anywhere in the range history**
   (``base..head``, not just the net tree-to-tree diff) is inside the caller's
   declared touched set (evaluated with ``scope_gate.check_scope``, one glob
   implementation). A path added and then deleted still counts — net two-dot
   ``git diff`` cannot see it, but the blob would still land in history.
4. **Mergeable** — fast-forward preferred; otherwise a conflict-free merge.
5. **Target** — the integration branch only. A target resolving to ``main``/
   ``master`` aborts the merge path rather than landing on mainline.

**Gate 6 — the human answer — is not enforceable here and is deliberately absent.**
It lives in the ``/work`` skill: the operator must answer the culmination question
in-session. Do not add a ``--yes``/``--confirmed`` flag; a flag is exactly the
inference this path forbids, and a fleet worker that could pass one would be able
to merge unattended.

Refusal is the safe outcome everywhere: any failed check routes the work back to
``/review`` rather than landing something unreviewed. This script never pushes,
never force-updates, never deletes a branch, and never touches mainline.

Usage:
  python merge_feature.py --root . --slug my-plan --touched touched.txt --dry-run
  python merge_feature.py --root . --slug my-plan --touched - --base <sha> \\
      --expect-head <sha>

Exit codes: 0 merged, would merge under --dry-run, or nothing to merge because the
branch is already contained in the target, 2 git error, 3 scope
violation, 4 precondition failed, 5 merge conflict, 6 merge staged (not committed;
run --commit-staged or --abort-staged after /commit-prep).
