"""Structured handoff: how a task that outgrew one context window becomes a
planned continuation instead of a context-rot failure.

An executor approaching its declared `## Budget` ceiling emits the handoff
template (`anchor/templates/handoff.md`) rather than a partial result. This
module is the machine side of that contract:

* :func:`looks_like_handoff` — cheap detection, so the orchestrator can tell a
  handoff from a normal task result before it applies the output-footer check.
* :func:`parse_handoff` — strict parse into :class:`Handoff`. Remaining work that
  is not dispatchable (no ``Verify by``) is an error, not a shrug: a vague
  "finish the rest" item is exactly what makes a continuation fail.
* :func:`build_continuation` — the next window's task text: original task, minus
  what is done, plus the handoff as provided context. Scope may only shrink.

The model's handoff is an *input*. Whether a handoff happens at all, and how many
are allowed, is the orchestrator's call (`scripts/orchestrate.py`) — never the
executor's.
