# Plan: <title>

<!-- When writing into a repo that uses `./.plans`, use /draft (planning mode)
     so agents save under drafts/ until a human moves the file into bugs/ or
     features/. Agent finish: in-progress/ → review-needed/ when Done when holds;
     human /review Approve → completed/. Private plans: /draft --local →
     <slug>.local.md (gitignored). See `.plans/README.md`.

     Path is authoritative — do NOT put Lane: or Status: in the file.
     drafts/ = not ready · bugs|features/ = ready · review-needed/ = await human
     · completed/ = done. -->

- **Value:** high | medium | low          <!-- features only; omit for bugs -->
- **Priority:** P1 | P2 | P3               <!-- P1 > P2 > P3; default P2 if omitted; orders within a lane -->
- **Slug:** <filename without .md and without .local>
- **Preferred models:** <names and/or tiers — who should execute this plan>
- **Assignee:** ai                          <!-- optional; default ai. A person's name/username/email (or `human`) marks a plan agents must NOT auto-claim — a human completes it; agents may still edit its body for status/comments and commit that -->
- **Depends on:** <comma-separated plan slugs, or `none`>  <!-- other .plans work that must be done first -->

## Goal
<one sentence — the user-visible outcome>

## Context read
<files/docs actually read to form this plan>

## Dependencies (how to fill)

Before finalizing this plan, **inventory existing plans** under `.plans/` (all lanes:
drafts, bugs, features, in-progress, ambiguous, blocked, completed). For each other
plan, read at least its Goal (and Done when if present) and decide whether *this*
work should wait on it:

- Shared modules, APIs, or scaffolds that plan must land first → list its **Slug**
- Same problem already tracked elsewhere → depend on it or merge; do not duplicate
- Only soft thematic overlap → do **not** depend; mention under Context if useful

Write slugs in **Depends on** (header). Executors **must not** start this plan while
any dependency is unmet (still open outside `completed/`, and not evidenced complete
in git history of `completed/`). Use `none` if you truly checked and found none.

Optional detail list:

```markdown
## Depends on (detail)
- `other-slug` — why this blocks us
```

## Constraints
- <hard constraints: language, versions, style, perf, no-touch zones>

## Conventions
<language/framework from ANCHOR-CONVENTIONS.md (or detected/asked directly) + its idiomatic composition mechanism — see .anchor/ANCHOR.md "Code quality defaults". SOLID applies regardless.>

## Steps
| # | Task | Touches | Verify by | Route to |
|---|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | <atomic task> | <files> | <command/check> | <model tier> |

## Risks
- <risk → mitigation>

## Escalation triggers
- Ambiguous requirement discovered → back to planner
- Task fails verification twice → bigger model
- Architectural decision needed → bigger model / human
- Step looks overqualified for its assigned tier (boilerplate/rename/formatting on a frontier route) → downgrade to smaller/local model instead

## Done when
- <machine-checkable conditions, all must hold>

### Preferred models (for plan drafters)

Fill **Preferred models** from plan complexity so cheap/capable executors find the right work and expensive tiers leave it alone. `/work` skips poor-fit plans unless the user names the plan or passes `--no-fit-check` (still one plan — not the whole backlog).

Use **model names** and/or **tiers** (see `.anchor/ANCHOR.md` routing + `.anchor/model-fitness.md`):

| Tier | Typical models | Good for |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `small` | Haiku, Qwen3 4–8B, Gemma 3 12B | Boilerplate, renames, formatting, thin docs |
| `mid` | Sonnet-class, Grok 4.5, Qwen3 32B, GPT Terra | Scoped multi-file features, refactors, routine reviews |
| `reasoner` | Opus-class, Nemotron thinking-on, R1 distill | Architecture, deep single-bug, security-adjacent |
| `frontier` | Fable-class | Multi-hour autonomy, large migrations, multi-service debug |

Examples:

- `mid` — any solid executor; not worth frontier credits
- `Claude Sonnet 5, Grok 4.5, Qwen3 32B` — named fleet picks
- `reasoner, frontier` — needs a strong reasoner; small/mid should skip
- `small, mid` — keep frontier/Opus off this work

Omit only when unsure; default assumption for executors is **mid**. Per-step **Route to** still applies inside the plan for mixed-difficulty steps.

### Assignee (human-owned plans)

**Assignee** answers *who owns completion*, which is separate from *which model executes* (**Preferred models**). It defaults to **ai** — leave it off and any agent may claim the plan. Set it to a person's **name, username, or email** (or the literal `human`) for work that a person must finish: a release sign-off, a manual QA pass, anything gated on human judgment or access.

An agent-assigned plan (absent, `ai`, `agent`, `unassigned`) is claimable as normal. A human-assigned plan is **auto-skipped** by `/work`, `plan_fit.py`, `work_once.py`, and the coordinator MCP — no agent claims it or moves it to in-progress/review-needed/completed. Agents may still **read it and edit its body** (add a `## Progress`/status note, answer a question) and commit that change; only *completing* it is reserved. `work_once.py --allow-assigned` forces a named claim when an operator really wants an agent to take it.
