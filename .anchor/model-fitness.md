# Model fitness — where each model excels, where it fails

Reviewed **2026-08-12** (Grok 4.6 + effort-effective tier; dual-axis specialty profiles). Frontier entries move fast; treat vendor-reported numbers as
`(unverified)` until your own `benchmark.py` run says otherwise — that table, not this
file, is your routing policy. This file exists for the *fit check* (below): a model
handed a task should be able to look itself up, see the task lands in its weak column,
and say so before burning tokens.

## The fit check (every model, every task) — dual-axis

Before planning (and on each **user-submitted** interactive prompt that sets or
redirects work), compare the pending task against your row below and the project's
`ANCHOR-CONVENTIONS.md` / `.anchor/conventions.md` model-routing / **Preferred
orchestrator** sections. Fit is a **gate**, not chatter. Run **two axes in order**
— power first, then specialty. Power is **bidirectional** (too hard → escalate,
too easy → downgrade); specialty is always a **lateral** re-route. Good fit on
**both** axes → emit **nothing** about models and proceed.

### Axis 1 — power (tier / weak column / orchestration)

#### Too hard → escalate (mythos-core rule 11)

If the task lands in your **weak** column — or is orchestration-class work and you
are not that preferred orchestrator:

1. Entire first line: `SUGGEST-ESCALATE: <better-suited model or role/tier> — <one-line reason>`
   (prefer the project's Preferred orchestrator when set)
2. Stop. Do not begin the task.
3. Proceed only if the operator insists — then stay in scope and mark `(unverified)`.

**Heuristics (up):** multi-service architecture, multi-hour autonomy, security-adjacent
deep dives, weak-column hit, orchestration / cross-plan **Depends on** when you are
not the Preferred orchestrator.

**Temporary coordinator:** if Preferred orchestrator is **unset** and no project MCP
coordinator is registered, a **frontier / near-frontier** model (Fable-class,
Opus-class, strong GPT-5.x, Grok 4.6 (or 4.5) as session lead, etc.) may temporarily
coordinate: inventory `.plans/**`, propose **Depends on**, draft under `drafts/`.
Announce `TEMPORARY-COORDINATOR: <name> — Preferred orchestrator unset`. Mid, small,
and local models must **not** self-appoint—escalate to a stronger session or the
operator. Recommend setting a durable orchestrator with
`anchor <project> --set-orchestrator …`.

#### Too easy → downgrade (mythos-core rule 10)

If the task is **clearly over-tier** for this session (premium/frontier capacity on
trivial work):

1. Entire first line: `SUGGEST-DOWNGRADE: <cheaper model or tier> — <one-line reason>`
2. **Stop and wait** — `orchestrate.py` honors the token immediately (no retry
   burn) but does not itself pick or dispatch a cheaper endpoint; the operator
   (interactive) or an unattended caller re-dispatches to the suggested target.
   Proceed only if they insist / “do it here” / `--insist` — then mark shaky
   judgment `(unverified)` if unsure.
3. Prefer targets from the project’s model-priority list or a reachable local swarm.

**Heuristics (down, conservative):** boilerplate, formatting-only, renames, a single
well-specified function, pure classification/summary glue. Do **not** downgrade merely
because “a cheaper model exists” for normal mid-tier multi-file work.

Examples:

- `SUGGEST-DOWNGRADE: small — rename-only; Haiku/local swarm is enough`
- `SUGGEST-DOWNGRADE: qwen3:4b-local — formatting pass; keep frontier for architecture`

### Axis 2 — specialty (computational / product profile)

If power is OK (or unknown) but you are the **wrong kind of model** for the work —
same power band, different product shape — re-route **laterally**:

1. Entire first line: `SUGGEST-REROUTE: <target model or profile tag> — <one-line reason>`
2. Stop (unless the operator insists — then proceed `(unverified)`).

**Closed profile tags (v1):**

| Profile tag | Work shape | Illustrative products |
|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| `coding-agent` | Multi-file software, tests, repo tools, PR-shaped work | Claude Code / Sonnet-class IDE agents, coding-tuned locals |
| `terminal-agent` | Long CLI / shell / fleet script runs | Grok Build–class terminal agents |
| `critic` | Review, race conditions, hard single-problem reasoning | R1 distills, Nemotron thinking-on, Opus-class deep dives |
| `planner` | Cross-plan Depends on, architecture, orchestration | Preferred orchestrator / frontier coordinator |
| `general-chat` | Spec shaping, explanation, single-turn Q&A without repo agency | ChatGPT Instant / pure chat UIs |
| `multimodal` | Screenshots, diagrams, image+code | Vision-capable endpoints |
| `swarm-local` | Thin boilerplate on host-local cheap models | Qwen3 4B/8B local swarm |

**Example first lines (specialty, not power-up):**

- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: coding-agent — leave multi-file software execution for a software-dev optimized model`
- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: Claude Sonnet 5 — general-chat session cannot run shell/repo tools`
- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: coding-agent — bulk implementation is wrong shape for R1-distill`
- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: coding-agent — swarm-local 4B/8B is thin glue only, not this multi-service edit`
- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: multimodal — task needs screenshot/vision; this endpoint is text-only`
- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: terminal-agent — long fleet shell run fits Grok/CLI agent better than pure chat`
- `SUGGEST-REROUTE: multimodal — long visual design doc is wrong shape for a terminal-only session`

Decision order: **power first** (escalate if underqualified/weak-column); else **specialty**;
else silent proceed. Specialty is never “a stronger model exists.”

Plans may list profile tags in **Preferred models** next to tiers/names
(e.g. `mid, coding-agent` or `coding-agent, Claude Sonnet 5`). Mechanical
`/work` fit still keys on **tiers + names** only; unknown profile tokens are
ignored by `plan_select` — they guide **self-assessment**, not the picker floor.

### What does *not* trigger the fit check

The gate is your **weak column**, orchestration-class work, **clear over-tier**
work, and **material specialty mismatch**. It is not a general licence to
decline. Over-shy escalation, spam downgrade, and over-eager re-route all have a
cost the transcript never shows: the plan sits in the backlog, the operator
waits, and a model that could have finished it is idle. Do **not** escalate,
downgrade, or re-route merely because:

- **A stronger model exists.** True of nearly every task; not a fit verdict.
- **A plan's `Preferred models` names a stronger product.** Only listed **tiers**
  (`small | mid | reasoner | frontier`) set the power floor — names are extra
  good-fit hits, not a raised bar. A list with no tier and no name you match is
  *unknown* fit, which is **eligible** (`/work` and `scripts/plan_select.py`).
- **The task is unfamiliar or multi-file *within your profile*.** Unfamiliar is
  what a task spec and the repo are for. Multi-file coding work *is* a specialty
  mismatch for pure `general-chat` / no-tools sessions — not for a coding-agent mid.
- **A single step looks hard.** Claim the plan; route or escalate *that step*
  (per-step `Route to`, `## Escalation triggers`), or hand the plan back to ready.

Escalating, downgrading, or re-routing when you shouldn't is a real failure mode,
not the safe default — it just fails quietly. Weigh it the same way you weigh
attempting work above your tier or outside your profile.

## Frontier / API models

| Model | Profiles | Excels at | Weak at / quirks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Fable 5 | `planner`, `coding-agent`, `critic` | Long-horizon autonomous work, large migrations, multi-service debugging, final review of big merges | Credit-metered — wasting it on keystrokes is an economics failure, not a capability one |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | `critic`, `planner`, `coding-agent` | Deep single-problem reasoning, architecture calls, security-adjacent work | Overkill for scoped edits; slower/pricier than Sonnet on routine execution |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | `coding-agent` | Default executor: scoped multi-file edits, solid tool use, good cost/quality | Hands multi-hour autonomy and hardest architecture calls up a tier |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `coding-agent` (light), `swarm-local`-adjacent | Classification, summaries, spec-tuning, cheap pipeline glue | Multi-file reasoning, subtle bug hunts |
| GPT-5.6 Sol (public 2026-07-09) | `coding-agent` | Agentic coding + cybersecurity tasks — benchmark leader `(unverified, vendor)` | **Documented over-eagerness**: OpenAI's own system card notes a greater tendency than GPT-5.5 to exceed user intent — unrequested "cleanup" actions and **claiming unperformed work**. Scope and verification gates are mandatory, not optional |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | `coding-agent` | ~GPT-5.5 quality at roughly half the cost `(unverified, vendor)` — the economics pick for executor work | Same system-card caveats as Sol; benchmarks vendor-reported |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | `coding-agent` (light) | Frontier-adjacent quality at budget price ($1/$6) — strong tuner/executor-light | Thinnest tier of the family; keep it off architecture and review roles |
| ChatGPT (product: GPT-5.5 + Instant Mini fallback) | `general-chat` (primary); Instant Mini stays chat | Conversational spec-shaping, explanations, one-step-per-turn piloted work | No shell/file access: every "it works" is a claim on the human's behalf; fallback routing means tier varies mid-session — **re-route multi-file software to `coding-agent`** |
| Grok 4.6 (public 2026-08-12) | `terminal-agent`, `coding-agent` | **Heavier Grok:** long-running agents, multi-step codebase work, ambitious interactive/visual projects; vendor Sol-class composite `(unverified)`; **base catalog mid** + effort-effective tier (see below). Prefer when the task needs sustained multi-step agent work | Same effort map as 4.5; repo-scale DeepSWE-class results not yet locally confirmed for 4.6 — file-scoped decompose until observed; default effort high; **xhigh** 4.6-only; **use 4.5 instead for thin/cheap mid work** |
| Grok 4.5 (public 2026-07-09) | `terminal-agent`, `coding-agent` | **Lighter / cheaper Grok** while still available: terminal/CLI-driven tasks, long tool-use, token-efficient scoped execution; **base catalog mid** + same effort map (`xhigh` coerced to `high` → reasoner). Prefer for mechanical mid, file-scoped execute, and cost-sensitive runs | Repo-scale measurably behind Fable-class (DeepSWE); tool-use flakiness `(unverified)`; may be phased out later — keep configs that name **both** `grok:4.5` and `grok:4.6` so a sunset is a one-line priority edit, not a rewrite |
| Gemini (2.5-class) | `multimodal`, `general-chat` | Long-context ingestion, multimodal analysis, breadth | Same external-verification rules as everyone; keep task specs self-contained |
| Nemotron Super/Ultra (NIM) | `critic`, `planner` (thinking-on); executor only thinking-off | Local planner/critic stand-in when frontier is metered; clean thinking toggle | Fabricates unfamiliar APIs under pressure; don't leave thinking on for bulk execution |

## Local models

Model names link to the **official quick start** (download / serve / templates). Anchor adaptations: `platforms/local-models/`.

| Model | Profiles | Excels at | Weak at / quirks |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Qwen3](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html) 32B / 30B-A3B | `coding-agent` (32B); `swarm-local` (≤8B) | Scoped spec-driven edits; 32B `/think` is a credible checklist critic | Planner only for small plans; ≤8B variants need the small-context guardrail; never greedy in thinking mode — **re-route large software plans off tiny swarm locals** |
| [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core) 27B | `coding-agent` | Best-in-class instruction following for its size; obedient executor | No system role (fold quirk); agreeable — attempts underspecified tasks unless the BLOCKED guardrail is injected; weak at catching logic errors as critic |
| [Mistral Small 3.x](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503) | `coding-agent` | Fast executor; best local JSON/function-calling per GB | Terse — skips footers under load (format-gate it); under-explains reasoning; won't ask clarifying questions readily |
| [DeepSeek-R1 distills](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1) | `critic` | Best local critic per GB; hard single problems (race conditions, algorithm choice) | NOT an executor — slow, token-hungry, over-refactors; no system prompt; no few-shot; greedy decoding breaks it — **bulk implement → `SUGGEST-REROUTE: coding-agent`** |
| [Llama 3.3 70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) | `coding-agent`, `critic` | Generalist executor+critic in one box; conservative planner | Confident fabrication — polished answers with an invented function in the middle; verbose without token caps |


## Effort as effective tier (Grok family) — 4.6-era

### Which Grok product (cost / weight)

Keep **both** first-class until 4.5 is retired. Prefer the lighter product when it is enough:

| Product | Prefer for | Avoid for |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Grok 4.5** | Cheaper/lighter mid: file-scoped execute, terminal/CLI, mechanical multi-file, cost-sensitive agent runs | Sustained multi-hour agent loops, ambitious greenfield apps (use 4.6) |
| **Grok 4.6** | Heavier agent work: long multi-step coding, interactive/visual projects, when 4.5 quality is not enough | Pure renames/format (downgrade effort or use 4.5 / small local) |

**Model-priority tokens** (examples): put the cheap side earlier when both are allowed, e.g.
`…, grok:4.5, grok:4.6, claude:sonnet, …` — walk the list; only escalate product when fit/quality requires it. Bare `grok` means “any Grok session”; prefer **versioned** tokens so a 4.5 sunset is a one-line edit.

### Effort dial (both products)

A **reported** reasoning effort sets the session’s **effective fit tier** for Preferred
matching (`plan_fit` / `plan_select` / `work_once --effort`). **Grok-only**; other
products keep effort as a cost dial.

| Grok effort | Effective fit tier | Typical use |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------|
| `low` / `minimal` / `none` | `mid` | Mechanical / file-scoped — prefer **4.5** when available |
| `medium` / `high` (API default) | `reasoner` | Harder single problems / architecture-ish — **4.6** often better value |
| `xhigh` (4.6 only; 4.5 `xhigh` coerces to `high` → **reasoner**) | `frontier` (4.6 only) | Explicit max depth/cost — opt-in only |

**Unknown / omitted effort → `mid`** (unattended workers without `--effort` stay mid;
do not inherit API default high as silent promotion).

**Base catalog tier** remains **mid** for 4.5 and 4.6. Controls: TUI
`/effort low|medium|high|xhigh`; CLI `--effort`; fleet quirk `reasoning_effort:`
(`anchor_client.py`).

**Weak column still binds** at every effort and product generation. Vendor agentic
claims stay `(unverified)` until observed locally.


## Observed data (preferred over vendor claims)

Vendor scorecards and the rows above are **starting priors**. After you run
`orchestrate.py` (or any path that records task outcomes), prefer **locally
observed** claim-vs-actual rates:

1. Ledger: append-only JSONL at `var/fleet-metrics/outcomes.jsonl` (metadata only —
   model, tier, task id hash, claimed status, verify exit, optional scope verdict;
   no prompts or task bodies). Written by `orchestrate.py` at each task's verify
   step via `scripts/fleet_metrics.py`.
2. Report: `python scripts/fitness_report.py` (table) or `--json` — per-model
   claim accuracy, verify pass-rate, unparseable rate. Rates with **n < 5** are
   withheld so small samples do not look like truth.
3. **Humans** update this file's prose from the report. Nothing rewrites
   `model-fitness.md` automatically.

The model's claim of success is an input to verification, never a substitute —
this ledger instruments that sentence. Rotate or truncate the JSONL manually if
it grows large; automated rotation is out of scope here.

## How this file is used

- Scaffolded into every project (core doctrine file); `ANCHOR-CONVENTIONS.md` adds the
  operator's model-priority order next to it.
- `mythos-core.md` rules 10–11 make the **dual-axis, bidirectional** fit check
  binding for every fleet worker; `orchestrate.py` treats `SUGGEST-ESCALATE`
  (power, up) and `SUGGEST-DOWNGRADE` (power, down) — rule 10 — and
  `SUGGEST-REROUTE` (specialty) — rule 11 — as immediate fit gates (no burned
  attempts) unless run with `--insist`. The token may be the entire first line,
  or follow mythos-core rule 13's six-line preflight block; later prose quoting
  the tokens is ignored.
- Re-review this file when a listed model ships a major version; entries carry the
  review date above. Prefer observed fitness report numbers over vendor claims
  when sample sizes are large enough (see above).
